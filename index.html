    <h1>My First HTML page</h1>
    <p>
       Hi, my name is <i><b>Jesse Adjei Kyereko Boateng</b></i> and I am learning html with <b>Mr Isaac Osafo</b>
       who is an expert at <b>Azubi Africa</b>.<br> 
       I am excited to study html with Azubi Africa because they have proven to be 
       one of the best in the tech industry in Africa over the past few years.<br> 
       My dream is to become a frontend developer and one of the best!
    </p>

    <h2>My Motivation</h2>
    <p>
        I enrolled in the <b>frontend developer program</b> because frontend development is a highly creative field
        that allows you to build <mark>user-friendly websites and application</mark>.<br>
        It is a <u><mark>highly sought after skill and rewarding career</mark></u> that is expected to grow bigger in some few years.<br>
        Moreover, frontend development is constantly evolving with new frameworks and tools hence,
        you have to learn <i>consistently</i> to be on top.<br>
        Lastly, it has a flexible structure which makes developers work remotely from any parts of the world without being at the workplace.
